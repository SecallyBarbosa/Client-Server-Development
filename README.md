How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

When creating software that is maintainable, readable, and adaptale I use the best of my knowledge in coding practices. I try to make software that can easily be used from one project to another, as shown in project 1 and 2. Making code that is easy to maintain increases production time and is easier to manipulate in terms of troubleshooting. Running into issues throughout the modules was true, but the clear coding practices and comments between codes made it easy to go back and work through.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I try my best to use critical thinking skills and look at one issue at a time. I also like to look at other very similar examples, and other ways to code in the future to prevent said issues. I also like to document any issues I run into so that way I can refer to it if the same issues come up again. Developing test cases also help in these situations because it provides proof that the software is or is not working properly up to the point that is completed. Continuing to use these methos will lead to successful coding and software.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

When a challenge is found by computer scientists, they test their solutions. This is very important in terms of always making sure things are working properly. Using the practices that I did throughout this course/project will help save time and space for companies like this one.
